# Deep Learning Specialization by Andrew Ng
master Deep Learning, understand how to apply it, and build a career in AI

## What I have learned in five courses:
In five courses, I have learned the foundations of Deep Learning, understand how to build neural networks, and learned how to lead successful machine learning projects. I have learned about Convolutional networks, RNNs, LSTM, Adam, Dropout, BatchNorm, Xavier/He initialization. I have done case studies from healthcare, autonomous driving, sign language reading, music generation, and natural language processing. I have mastered not only the theory, but also how it is applied in industry. I have practiced in Python, TensorFlow, and keras.
